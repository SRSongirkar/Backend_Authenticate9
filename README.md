Coding Task

Create a REST api to be consumed by a mobile app, which is somewhat similar to various popular apps
which tell you if a number is spam, or allow you to find a personâ€™s name by searching for their phone
number.
You can use any NodeJs framework to accomplish this task.
For persistence you need to use a relational database along with an ORM for your framework.
